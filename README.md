* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive 

* [hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) - hvPlot provides an alternative for the static plotting API provided by Pandas and other libraries

* [pathlib](https://stackabuse.com/introduction-to-the-python-pathlib-module/) - provides a more readable and easier way to build up paths by representing filesystem paths as proper objects and enables us to write code that is portable across platforms
